# VarshneyWebsite
Website of Prof. Amitabh Varshney, written in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and build with Python
This is still a static website, but we suggest you modify data files, and rebuild the pages with Python,
instead of modifying the HTML directly.
# How to Build
* First, install Python 3, any version: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# How to revise
* To change bio, medias, and publications, modify data/bio.txt, data/media.json, and data/publications.json
* To change everything else, modify index.content.html, media.content.html, and etc.
* Rebuild the project by build.py
